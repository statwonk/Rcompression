Now we want to be able to extract files from ZIP archives.  For
example, we would like to be able to read Office 2008 documents which
are ZIP archives, i.e. .docx files.  Given a file name, we want to use
unzOpen() and then move to the relevant file via unzGoToNextFile().
We can determine how many times to call this by looking in the global
info table.  We call unzGoToFirstFile() and then unzGoToNextFile().
From the info table, we know how many bytes the content of the file
occupies.  We can get these as raw bytes.  How do we then uncompress
the actual content?

We use the primitives in the approach above in the implementation of
getZipInfo. So looks like we are good to go.

See  do_extract_currentfile in miniunz.c.
unzOpenCurrentFilePassword
unzReadCurrentFile
Basically, repeated calls to 
unzReadCurrentFile where the return value is greater than 0
we can fill up the buffer.

<para>
We can call unzLocateFile for a given filename within the archive.
We can also do this in R from the info.

We would also like to be able supply the password for a 
password-protected ZIP file.
